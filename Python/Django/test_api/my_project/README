 - pip freeze > requirements.txt : This will create a requirements.txt file, which contains a simple list of all the packages in the current environment, and their respective versions.
 - pip install -r requirements.txt : Later it will be easier for a different developer (or you, if you need to re-create the environment) to install the same packages using the same versions
